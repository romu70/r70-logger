# Simple logger

This is a simple logger module, written in Js. It's intended to become a NPM module as quick as possible. Of course, NPM is probably full of logger modules. This one is mainly an educative project for me, I don't have a Js background.

It is developed following the TDD principles, the tests case are made with Tape.
